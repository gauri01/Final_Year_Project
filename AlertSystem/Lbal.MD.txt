based application to handle the following requirements: 
To alert the users through an alarm when the user reaches
 near a preset location, To retrieve the users current 
location coordinates (Latitudes and Longitudes), To allows users
 to set their target location and save that target to the list, 
Allows user to delete and edit the alarms, 
To allow user to the put the reminder text along with the alarm. 
The final system allow user to easily activate alarm in the mobile device.

when the user reaches the target location. This mobile alarm 
service will act as assistance for the frequent travellers to visit new places.
